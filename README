sfakeroot
=========

sfakeroot is a minimalist fakeroot[1]. It uses the same LD_PRELOAD tricks
as fakeroot to provide an environment in which stat() and related calls
return uid/gid 0, so that files appear to be owned by root even when they're
not. Inside the fakeroot environment permissions can be modified as if the
current user is root, though ownership of the underlying files is never
really changed. Any permissions set within the fakeroot environment will
last only for the duration of the session, once sfakeroot exits all changes
are lost.

Why?
----

sfakeroot was written because there is no OpenBSD compatible fakeroot
equivalent, I considered porting fakeroot but it seemed too difficult.

Installation
------------

To build just run:

    $ make

followed by (as root),

    # make install

to install to standard locations.

You can also uninstall with (as root),

    # make uninstall

Known issues
------------

Since OpenBSD's base utils are statically linked sfakeroot may be less
useful on OpenBSD than it is on Linux, since the LD_PRELOAD tricks only
work with dynamically linked executables. Even with dynamically linked
executables sfakeroot may be of limited use for any programs using pledge(),
since sfakeroot may try to make use of syscalls not specified in the pledge()
call thereby causing sfakeroot to be terminated with SIGABRT.

To make better use of sfakeroot on OpenBSD you may wish to use it with sbase[2].
